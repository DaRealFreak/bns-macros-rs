# Aerodrome Exp Bot
[![build](https://github.com/DaRealFreak/bns-macros-rs/actions/workflows/build_aerodrome_exp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DaRealFreak/bns-macros-rs/actions/workflows/build_poharan.yml)  
Bot to farm the dungeon "Aerodrome" on your preferred stage automatically for extremely fast experience. Use at your own risk, this can get you banned if NCSoft suddenly decides that they care about their game again.

## Installation
Create a folder `configuration` and run the `bns-aerodrome-exp.exe` in your preferred directory. This will create a basic `aerodrome-exp.ini` file which is used to change keys and color checks to match your key bindings and ClientConfiguration.xml.

## Configuration
For Keybindings you should refer to [Virtual-Key Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).
For Positions and Colors you can use external tools like AutoHotkey scripts or Snipping Tools.
The bns-macros project of this repository also outputs the coordinates/hex color of the current mouse position which can be used to set everything up.

## Usage
After changing all the settings in the `aerodrome-exp.ini` you can simply run the `bns-aerodrome-exp.exe` and tab into the game while being in the Demonsbane lobby in F8.  
If you want to stop the bot simply tab out of the game or close the console window.
